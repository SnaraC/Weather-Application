# Real-time traffic and weather application

Instructions:

To access real-time traffic and weather forecast information, please enter a valid city name in the search bar.

The user interface consists of two screens. The screen below the search bar provides real-time traffic updates, while the screen to the right displays the weather forecast.

For real-time traffic on Google Maps:

Three buttons are available for users to select and view regular, transit, and bike traffic information. These options utilize the Google API to retrieve the relevant data.

For real-time weather:

Users are presented with "Today" and "Weekly" buttons.

By clicking the "Today" button, the screen will display the current time, date, current weather conditions, and highlights for the day.

Selecting the "Weekly" button will show the temperature forecast for the next five days.

Note: Google Map Traffic API has been disable, so the map won't work anymore as project completed.
